		I look back on the day we first met — the day we so casually decided, “Oh well, let’s meet this stranger.” I took you to see my favourite ice cream shop, but of course it was closed. We went to another shop, I spotted a small portion, and I bought it for you. We then went by the bridge, sat, and ate our ice cream.
		</p>

		<p>
		I have a habit of studying people’s faces and eyes to get a sense of who they are. That day I took a good look at you, and you seemed like someone who appreciates the little things in life. Seeing you enjoy my yapping made my day. I waited until you were ready to go out with me again because I wanted to see how eager you were, and I wasn’t surprised when you wanted to go out again. From then on I looked forward to our time together and loved our conversations.
		</p>

		<p>
		That night by the Joali, seeing you worried and anxious made me feel the same, and I was unsure how things would go afterward. But once I got home, all I could think about was you. That’s when I realised I liked you and felt the urge to protect your peace and endure the unpredictability — you had already left a mark on me.
		</p>

		<p>
		I’m so glad we’ve come this far and that things have turned out for the better. I don’t just like you anymore — I love you, Inaan. You’re the first and last thing on my mind every day.
		</p>

		<p class="proposal">I know I haven't formally asked you this yet. I know how much we mean to each other, but I need to hear this from you directly. Inaan, will you be my girlfriend? 😊 Please text me your response on Instagram.</p>
